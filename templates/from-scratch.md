# Building from Scratch

Creating a website from scratch with Kliv requires providing detailed, comprehensive information to help the AI understand exactly what you want to build. The quality and specificity of your initial prompt directly determines how well the AI can tailor your site to your needs.

## The Importance of Detailed Prompts

When you choose to build from scratch, your initial description serves as the foundation for everything Kliv creates. A generic request like "I want a site for my business" will result in a generic website because the AI has no context about your specific business, industry, or requirements. The AI will do its best to create something useful, but without detailed information, it can only generate a basic template-style site.

In contrast, providing comprehensive details about your business, goals, and preferences allows Kliv to create a highly customized website that feels specifically designed for your needs. This includes everything from the content structure and navigation to the visual design and functionality.

The more context you provide, the fewer iterations you'll need to get your site exactly right, ultimately saving you time and credits while producing better results.

## Essential Information to Include

For any business or organization, start with the fundamental details that define who you are and what you do. Include your business name, physical address if relevant, and a clear description of your products or services. If you offer specific packages, pricing tiers, or service categories, detail these explicitly along with their features and pricing.

Contact information is crucial—specify how customers should reach you, whether through phone, email, contact forms, or physical visits. If you have operating hours, service areas, or any restrictions on availability, include these details as well.

Don't forget to mention your target audience and what makes your business unique. Are you serving local customers or a global market? What's your competitive advantage? What tone should the site convey—professional and corporate, friendly and approachable, creative and artistic, or technical and precise?

## Visual and Design Preferences

Generic styling works for many situations, but specifying your design preferences creates a much more personalized result. If you have brand colors, mention the exact color palette you want to use. Describe the overall aesthetic you're aiming for—modern and minimalist, warm and welcoming, bold and energetic, or elegant and sophisticated.

Reference styles you admire if helpful, though be specific about what elements appeal to you rather than just naming other websites. Do you prefer clean layouts with lots of white space, or more content-dense designs? Should the navigation be prominent or subtle? Do you want large hero images or more text-focused sections?

Typography preferences matter too—should the site feel corporate with clean, professional fonts, or more creative with unique styling? These details help Kliv make design choices that align with your vision from the start.

## Technical Foundation

All Kliv sites are built on a modern, robust technical foundation using React and Vite for optimal performance and developer experience. The styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS, which provides consistent, professional design systems while maintaining flexibility for customization.

Every site generated by Kliv is automatically responsive, meaning it works seamlessly across all device sizes from desktop computers to mobile phones. The layouts adapt intelligently to different screen sizes, ensuring your content is always readable and your site remains functional regardless of how visitors access it.

Accessibility is built into every Kliv site by default. This means your website works properly with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies, ensuring it's usable by people with various disabilities. This accessibility compliance is handled automatically without requiring additional configuration or consideration on your part.

## Building Process and Iteration

When starting from scratch, expect the initial build to create the basic structure and primary pages of your site based on your prompt. You'll then refine and expand through conversation with the AI, adding details, adjusting layouts, and fine-tuning the content and design.

The iterative process works best when you review each change and provide specific feedback about what works and what needs adjustment. Rather than asking for broad changes, focus on specific elements—particular sections, individual pages, or specific features that need modification.

Remember that starting from scratch gives you complete creative control but requires more detailed communication with the AI to achieve your vision. The investment in providing comprehensive initial information and clear iterative feedback results in a truly custom website tailored specifically to your needs.
