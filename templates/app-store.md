# App Store Templates

The App Store contains a curated collection of templates created by Kliv and the community. These ready-to-use sites serve as starting points that you can immediately customize and make your own.

## How Templates Work

Templates in the App Store are complete websites with multiple pages, features, and functionality already built. When you find a template that closely matches your vision, you can install it with a single click and it becomes your new project instantly. Unlike traditional website builders where templates are just visual starting points, Kliv templates include working forms, navigation systems, responsive layouts, and interactive elements.

The key advantage of starting with a template is that you get a fully fleshed-out website from day one. This means you can focus on customization and content rather than explaining every detail about structure, layout, and functionality to the AI.

## Getting Started with Templates

Browse the template gallery to find something that aligns with your project goals. The templates are organized by category and use case, making it easy to find relevant options. Look for templates that are at least 70% similar to what you want to build, as this gives you the best starting point for customization.

When you click on any template, Kliv instantly creates a new project in your account with all the template's code, content, and functionality. You can immediately start modifying it by chatting with Kliv about changes you want to make. There's no setup time or configuration needed—the template becomes your working project immediately.

## Template Categories

The App Store organizes templates into several categories to help you find the right starting point. Business and corporate templates include professional company websites with service pages, team sections, and contact forms. Portfolio and creative templates showcase work for designers, photographers, artists, and other creative professionals.

E-commerce templates provide online stores with product catalogs, shopping cart functionality, and checkout systems. Blog and content templates offer publishing platforms with article layouts, author profiles, and content management features. Landing page templates focus on marketing and conversion goals with compelling hero sections, feature highlights, and call-to-action elements.

SaaS and app templates are designed for software products, including feature presentations, pricing tables, and user onboarding flows. Each category contains multiple templates with different styles, layouts, and feature sets to match various industries and preferences.

## Customization After Installation

Once you've installed a template, you have complete freedom to modify every aspect of the site. Start by replacing placeholder content with your own text, images, and branding. The AI assistant can help you change colors, fonts, layouts, and visual styling through natural conversation.

You can also request entirely new features and sections that weren't in the original template. Want to add a newsletter signup, integrate a booking system, or create a custom contact form? Simply ask Kliv to add these elements. You can reorganize existing sections, remove parts you don't need, or completely redesign areas that don't fit your vision.

The template serves as your foundation, but there are no limitations on how extensively you can modify it. Many successful projects start with templates but end up looking completely different after customization, combining the speed of a template start with the uniqueness of custom development.
