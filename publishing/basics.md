# Publishing Basics

Kliv automatically hosts and publishes your websites, making them instantly available to the world. Understanding how publishing works helps you manage your site's visibility and make updates confidently.

## Site URLs

Every Kliv project gets a unique URL following the pattern `yoursite.kliv.site`. When you create a new project, Kliv automatically generates this subdomain name for you. If you started with a template, the URL will be based on the original template's name and purpose. For projects built from scratch, Kliv's AI analyzes your initial prompt and creates a relevant, descriptive subdomain name.

You can edit your subdomain name at any time through your project settings. The only requirement is that the name must be unique across all Kliv sites. This means if someone else is already using `mystore.kliv.site`, you'll need to choose a different name like `mystore2.kliv.site` or `mystoreusa.kliv.site`.

## Auto-Publishing

By default, Kliv publishes your site automatically whenever you make changes. This means as soon as you ask Kliv to modify something and the AI completes the task, those changes are immediately live on your public URL. This instant publishing approach lets you see results quickly and share progress with others in real-time.

However, you can disable auto-publishing when you want more control over what goes live. This is particularly useful when you're making experimental changes, testing new features, or working on major redesigns that you want to review before making public. With auto-publishing disabled, you'll see a publish button that lets you manually push changes live when you're ready.

To toggle auto-publishing, look for the setting in your project's publishing options. Remember that even with auto-publishing off, your changes are still saved and visible in the preview panel—they just won't be visible to your site visitors until you manually publish.

## Free vs Pro Publishing

Free users receive complete hosting for their sites on the `yoursite.kliv.site` domain at no cost. Your site will include a small "Made with Kliv" badge, which helps support our platform while keeping the service free. You can still edit your subdomain name and have full control over your site's content and design.

Pro subscribers get all the same publishing features as free users, plus the "Made with Kliv" badge is automatically removed from their sites. Pro users also have access to custom domain connections, allowing you to use your own branded domain name instead of the Kliv subdomain. Additionally, Pro sites receive priority hosting performance with faster loading times and enhanced reliability.

Both free and pro sites are hosted on Kliv's global infrastructure with automatic HTTPS security, content delivery networks for fast loading worldwide, and 99.9% uptime reliability.
