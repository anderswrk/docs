# Publishing Basics

Your Kliv sites are automatically published and hosted for you. Here's how it works.

## Site URLs

Every site gets a unique URL: `yoursite.kliv.site`

**URL Generation:**
- **Templates:** Based on the original template name
- **From Scratch:** AI generates a relevant name based on your site
- **Editable:** Change your subdomain anytime (must be unique)

## Auto-Publishing

**Default Behavior:** Sites publish automatically when you make changes  
**Manual Control:** Turn off auto-publishing to preview changes before going live

**When to disable auto-publishing:**
- Making experimental changes
- Want to review before publishing
- Working on major redesigns

## Free vs Pro Publishing

**Free Users:**
- Free hosting on `yoursite.kliv.site`
- Editable subdomain name
- "Made with Kliv" badge displayed

**Pro Users:**
- All free features included
- No "Made with Kliv" badge
- Custom domain support
