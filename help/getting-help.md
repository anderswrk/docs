# Getting Help

When you need assistance with your Kliv projects, there are several ways to get the help you need quickly and effectively.

## Chat with Kliv for Site Issues

The fastest way to resolve issues with your website is to ask Kliv directly in the chat window. The AI assistant can help troubleshoot problems, fix bugs, and resolve technical issues in real-time. Simply describe what's not working or what error you're seeing, and Kliv will analyze your project and implement fixes automatically.

Kliv has access to your project code, console logs, and can see exactly what's happening with your site, making it the most effective first step for technical problems.

## Email Support

For general questions, account issues, or problems that can't be resolved through the AI chat, you can contact our support team directly:
