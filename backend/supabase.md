# Supabase Integration

Supabase integration provides your Kliv sites with backend functionality including user authentication, database management, and server-side code execution. This integration is essential for any site that needs user accounts, data storage, or advanced server-side features.

## What is Supabase?

Supabase is a backend-as-a-service platform built on PostgreSQL that provides authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions. Kliv has deep integration with Supabase, allowing the AI assistant to directly create and modify backend functionality without requiring manual database setup or server configuration.

When you connect Supabase to your Kliv project, you gain access to powerful backend capabilities including user management systems, data storage and retrieval, real-time subscriptions, file storage, and edge functions for server-side processing. The AI can automatically set up database tables, configure authentication flows, and implement complex data relationships based on your natural language requests.

This integration transforms your static Kliv sites into dynamic, data-driven applications with user accounts, personalized content, and interactive features that require backend processing.

## When You Need Supabase

Supabase integration is mandatory for any Kliv site functionality that requires backend support. This includes user authentication and login systems, user management and profiles, data storage and retrieval, server-side AI model execution, real-time features like chat or live updates, file uploads and storage, and any functionality requiring secure server-side processing.

If your site only displays static content without user accounts or dynamic data, you don't need Supabase integration. However, most modern web applications benefit from at least basic user authentication, making Supabase a valuable addition to most Kliv projects.

The integration is particularly powerful for membership sites, e-commerce applications, SaaS products, collaborative tools, and any application where users need to save data or maintain persistent state across sessions.

## Connecting Your Account

To set up Supabase integration, click the Supabase button in your Kliv project interface. This launches a guided setup process that helps you either connect an existing Supabase account or create a new one specifically for your Kliv projects.

If you're new to Supabase, the setup wizard will guide you through creating an account and establishing the connection. If you already have a Supabase account, you can link it directly to Kliv, allowing the AI to access your existing projects and data.

The connection process establishes secure API access that allows Kliv's AI to make changes directly to your Supabase configuration. This includes creating database tables, setting up authentication providers, configuring security rules, and deploying serverless functions based on your conversational requests.

## Project Linking

After connecting your Supabase account to Kliv, you can link individual Kliv sites to specific Supabase projects. This one-to-one relationship ensures that each website has its own isolated backend environment, preventing data mixing between different projects.

When you link a Kliv site to a Supabase project, the AI gains the ability to create and manage all backend functionality for that specific site. You can have multiple Kliv sites linked to different Supabase projects, or multiple sites sharing the same Supabase project if they need shared data and users.

The linking process is straightforward through the project settings, and you can change which Supabase project a site connects to at any time. This flexibility allows you to reorganize your backend architecture as your projects evolve.

## AI-Powered Backend Development

Once connected, Kliv's AI can implement complex backend functionality through natural conversation. You can request user registration and login systems, database schemas with relationships between tables, API endpoints for data access, real-time subscriptions for live updates, file upload and management systems, and custom serverless functions for complex business logic.

The AI understands Supabase's capabilities and automatically implements best practices for security, performance, and scalability. This includes setting up Row Level Security policies, configuring authentication providers, implementing proper data validation, and optimizing database queries for performance.

You don't need to understand database design or server architecture—simply describe what functionality you want, and the AI handles the technical implementation while explaining what it's building.

## Authentication and User Management

Supabase integration enables comprehensive user management systems with minimal setup. The AI can implement user registration with email verification, social login providers like Google and GitHub, password reset functionality, user profile management, role-based access control, and multi-factor authentication.

User sessions are automatically managed across your site, allowing personalized content, user-specific data access, and protected pages that require authentication. The AI can create user dashboards, account settings pages, and administrative interfaces for managing your user base.

All user data is securely stored in your Supabase project with industry-standard encryption and security practices, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining ease of use.

## Database and Data Management

The AI can design and implement complex database schemas based on your application requirements. This includes creating tables with proper relationships, setting up indexes for performance, implementing data validation rules, and configuring backup and recovery systems.

You can request features like user-generated content storage, product catalogs for e-commerce, booking systems with availability tracking, messaging systems with real-time updates, analytics and reporting capabilities, and custom data collection forms.

The PostgreSQL foundation provides powerful querying capabilities, data integrity, and scalability that grows with your application needs.

## Serverless Functions and Edge Computing

Supabase edge functions enable server-side processing for tasks that can't be handled in the browser. The AI can implement functions for payment processing, external API integrations, data analysis and reporting, image processing and optimization, email sending and notifications, and custom business logic that requires server-side security.

These functions automatically scale based on usage and integrate seamlessly with your frontend application, providing enterprise-grade backend capabilities without server management complexity.
