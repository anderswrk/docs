# Billing & Subscriptions

Kliv offers three subscription tiers designed to meet different needs, from individual experimentation to enterprise deployment. Each plan includes hosting, AI assistance, and collaboration features with varying credit allowances and advanced capabilities.

## Subscription Plans

### Free Plan
The free plan provides full access to Kliv's core features at no cost. You receive five credits per day with a monthly maximum of thirty credits, perfect for learning the platform and building smaller projects. Your sites are hosted on the `yoursite.kliv.site` domain with a small "Made with Kliv" attribution badge.

Free accounts support up to ten team members, making it suitable for small teams and collaborative projects. All core AI assistance, responsive design, and publishing features are included without time limits or feature restrictions.

### Professional Plan
Professional subscriptions remove usage limitations and provide enhanced features for serious development work. You receive a monthly credit allowance that varies by subscription tier, with the flexibility to use all credits in a single day or spread them throughout the month. Credits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle and do not roll over.

Professional subscribers can connect custom domains to their projects, removing the "Made with Kliv" attribution badge for a completely branded experience. The plan includes unlimited team members, priority hosting performance, and enhanced support response times.

Professional plans offer multiple tiers with different credit allowances, allowing you to choose the level that matches your development intensity and project requirements.

### Enterprise/Custom Plan
Enterprise solutions provide advanced features for larger organizations with specific security, compliance, or deployment requirements. This includes SAML integration for single sign-on, custom role-based permissions with granular access control, and the ability to create specialized user roles beyond the standard admin and regular user categories.

Enterprise customers can also request custom deployments, including dedicated Kliv instances running in your own AWS environment. This provides maximum control over data location, security policies, and performance optimization while maintaining full access to Kliv's AI-powered development capabilities.

Enterprise plans include dedicated support, custom feature development, and flexible billing arrangements to meet organizational procurement requirements. Contact our sales team for detailed enterprise feature discussions and custom pricing.

## Managing Your Subscription

Subscription changes are handled through the subscription management page in your account settings. You can upgrade to higher tiers, downgrade to lower tiers, or cancel your subscription entirely through this interface.

When upgrading, new features and credit allowances become available immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, ensuring you receive the full value of your current subscription period.

Cancellations can be processed at any time, with service continuing until the end of your paid period. After cancellation, your account automatically converts to the free plan, maintaining access to your projects while applying free tier limitations.

## Payment Security

All payment processing is handled through Stripe, a leading payment platform trusted by millions of businesses worldwide. Kliv never receives or stores your credit card information—all sensitive payment data is securely managed by Stripe's PCI-compliant infrastructure.

This approach ensures your payment information receives enterprise-grade security protection while providing convenient subscription management features. You can update payment methods, view billing history, and manage subscriptions directly through Stripe's secure interface.

Stripe supports all major credit cards, many debit cards, and various international payment methods, providing flexible options regardless of your location or preferred payment approach.

## Credit Monitoring

Your current credit balance is displayed above the chat window in every project, providing real-time visibility into your usage. This display shows both your remaining credits and your plan's refresh schedule, helping you track consumption and plan your development work.

Clicking on the credit display opens a detailed popup showing your credit usage history for the current month. This breakdown helps you understand your usage patterns, identify high-consumption activities, and optimize your development workflow to maximize the value of your credit allowance.

The credit monitor updates in real-time as you use the platform, ensuring accurate information for both planning and budgeting purposes. For professional and enterprise accounts, detailed usage analytics help track team consumption patterns and inform subscription tier decisions.

## Plan Comparisons

Choosing the right plan depends on your development intensity, team size, and feature requirements. Free plans work well for individuals learning the platform or building small projects with flexible timelines. Professional plans suit active developers, small businesses, and teams who need consistent development velocity without daily limitations.

Enterprise plans are designed for organizations requiring advanced security, custom deployments, or specialized compliance features. The custom nature of enterprise solutions ensures they can be tailored to meet specific organizational requirements while providing the scalability needed for large development teams.
