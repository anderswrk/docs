# Account Security

Protecting your Kliv account is essential for keeping your projects, code, and data secure. This page covers the security settings you can configure to strengthen your account protection.

## Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Kliv account regardless of which authentication method you use. Two-factor authentication adds an essential security layer that protects your account even if your password is compromised.

Passkeys offer the best security and user experience, using cryptographic keys stored on your devices for passwordless authentication. If passkeys aren't available on your devices, TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) provides excellent security and works with any authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password.

For teams and organizations, review your user access regularly and ensure that only current team members have access to your projects. When someone leaves your team, promptly remove their access through the user management interface.

## Authentication Options

Your Kliv account supports multiple authentication methods that you can configure through your user profile:

**Password-based login** works universally and provides the foundation for account access. Choose a strong, unique password that you don't use for other services.

**Passkeys** represent the most secure option, eliminating passwords entirely while providing seamless authentication across your devices.

**TOTP two-factor authentication** adds security to password-based login by requiring a time-based code from your authenticator app.

**Google OAuth** allows you to sign in with your existing Google account, leveraging Google's security infrastructure.

## Managing Your Security Settings

Access your security settings through your user profile to enable or disable authentication methods, set up two-factor authentication, and manage connected devices. The interface guides you through each setup process and provides recovery options in case you lose access to your authentication devices.

If you're using team collaboration features, additional security considerations apply. Review the [User Management documentation](/collaboration/user-management) for information about roles, permissions, and team security best practices.

## Platform Security

Beyond your account settings, Kliv maintains comprehensive security practices to protect your data, code, and projects. Our platform security measures, data protection policies, and compliance information are detailed on our [Security page](https://kliv.dev/en/security).

For enterprise customers, additional security features including SAML integration and custom role-based access control are available. See the [User Management documentation](/collaboration/user-management) for more information about enterprise security capabilities.
