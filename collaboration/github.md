# Version Control with GitHub

GitHub integration provides automatic version control for your Kliv projects, ensuring your source code is safely stored under your control while maintaining seamless synchronization between platforms.

## How GitHub Integration Works

When you connect your Kliv project to GitHub, every change made by the AI assistant automatically generates a commit and pushes to your connected repository. This creates a complete history of your project's development, with each AI modification documented as a separate commit with descriptive messages.

The integration operates bidirectionally, meaning changes flow both ways between Kliv and GitHub. When the AI makes edits in Kliv, those changes are immediately pushed to your GitHub repository. Conversely, if you make changes directly in GitHub, they are automatically pulled into your Kliv project and reflected in the live preview.

This seamless synchronization ensures your Kliv project and GitHub repository always stay in sync without manual intervention.

## Benefits of GitHub Integration

The primary advantage of connecting GitHub is having complete control over your source code. While Kliv maintains copies of your projects on our platform, GitHub integration gives you an independent backup under your own GitHub account. This provides peace of mind and ensures you always have access to your code, regardless of your Kliv subscription status.

GitHub integration also enables advanced development workflows. You can clone your repository to work locally with your preferred code editor, collaborate with team members through GitHub's tools, and leverage GitHub's ecosystem of integrations and deployment options. The full commit history provides detailed tracking of how your project evolved over time.

For developers who want the convenience of Kliv's AI-powered development combined with traditional version control practices, GitHub integration bridges both worlds effectively.

## Managing the Integration

The GitHub integration controls are accessible through the GitHub button in your project interface. This panel allows you to push changes from Kliv to GitHub, pull updates from GitHub to Kliv, and monitor the synchronization status between both platforms.

You can manually trigger push and pull operations when needed, though the automatic synchronization typically handles everything seamlessly. The control panel also provides status information about your last sync, any potential conflicts, and the health of your integration connection.

If you need to reconnect your repository or change which GitHub repository is linked to your project, these settings are also managed through the GitHub integration panel.

## Recommended Workflow

While the bidirectional sync supports various workflows, we recommend making changes primarily within Kliv rather than directly in GitHub. Working within Kliv ensures optimal integration with the AI assistant and maintains the seamless development experience the platform is designed to provide.

When you make changes in Kliv, the AI can understand the context and help optimize your code, suggest improvements, and maintain consistency with the rest of your project. Changes made directly in GitHub, while automatically synced, don't benefit from the AI's contextual understanding and assistance.

For occasional code reviews, advanced debugging, or collaboration with developers who prefer traditional tools, accessing your code through GitHub works perfectly. However, for primary development work, staying within Kliv provides the best experience and takes full advantage of the platform's AI capabilities.

The GitHub integration serves as both a safety net for your code and a bridge to traditional development tools when needed, while keeping Kliv as your primary development environment.
