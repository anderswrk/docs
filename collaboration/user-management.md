# User Management

Kliv accounts include built-in multi-user support, allowing you to collaborate with team members, clients, or co-workers on your projects. The system handles user invitations, role management, and authentication while keeping everything under your account's credit allowance.

## Team Collaboration Structure

Every Kliv account supports multiple users who can collaborate on projects within the same workspace. Team members share access to all projects under the account and work within the same credit pool, making it easy to manage costs while enabling flexible collaboration.

Free accounts support up to 10 users, which covers most small teams and personal collaborations. Professional accounts have no user limits, allowing you to invite as many collaborators as needed without additional per-user costs. All invited users operate under your account's credit allowance, so there are no surprise charges based on team size.

The shared credit system means your team can work collaboratively while staying within predictable usage limits. Credits are consumed based on AI interactions regardless of which team member initiates them, providing transparency and cost control for account administrators.

## User Roles and Permissions

Kliv implements a straightforward role-based system with two primary user types for free and professional accounts. Regular users can edit projects, interact with the AI assistant, and collaborate on development work. Admin users have all regular user capabilities plus the ability to manage the user list, send invitations, and access advanced account functionality.

Admin users control who has access to the account and can remove users when team composition changes. They also manage account-level settings and subscription details. Regular users focus on project development without administrative distractions, creating a clean separation between collaboration and management responsibilities.

For organizations requiring more sophisticated access control, enterprise accounts support custom role-based security with fine-grained permissions. This includes the ability to create custom policies, define multiple specialized roles, and control access to specific projects or features based on organizational needs.

## Adding Team Members

Inviting new users to your Kliv account is straightforward through the user management interface. Navigate to the user management screen in your account settings, enter the email address of the person you want to invite, and send the invitation. The invited user receives an email with instructions to join your account and access shared projects.

New users can either create a new Kliv account linked to your workspace or connect an existing Kliv account to your team. Once they accept the invitation, they immediately have access to all projects under your account and can begin collaborating using the shared credit allowance.

The invitation system ensures that only people you explicitly invite can access your projects. Users cannot discover or request access to accountsâ€”all collaboration happens through direct invitation from existing admin users.

## Authentication and Security

Kliv supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different security preferences and organizational requirements. Users can sign up with traditional email and password combinations, providing a familiar authentication experience that works universally.

For enhanced security, Kliv strongly recommends enabling two-factor authentication through either TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) or passkeys. TOTP works with any authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password, providing an additional security layer that prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

Passkeys represent the most secure authentication option, using cryptographic keys stored on your devices for passwordless login. This eliminates password-related vulnerabilities while providing a seamless user experience across devices and browsers.

Google OAuth integration allows users to sign in with their existing Google accounts, simplifying the login process while leveraging Google's security infrastructure. This option is particularly convenient for teams already using Google Workspace or Gmail.

## Enterprise Authentication Features

Enterprise accounts include advanced authentication capabilities designed for larger organizations with specific security requirements. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) integration enables single sign-on with existing identity providers, allowing users to access Kliv through their organization's existing authentication systems.

Single sign-on streamlines the user experience while maintaining centralized security control through your organization's identity management platform. This integration supports popular enterprise identity providers and can be configured to match your organization's specific authentication workflows.

Enterprise accounts also support custom user roles beyond the standard admin and regular user categories. Organizations can create specialized roles with precise permissions tailored to different job functions, project types, or security requirements. This granular control ensures users have appropriate access levels without over-privileging or restricting legitimate work needs.

## Security Best Practices

Regardless of your account tier, enabling two-factor authentication significantly improves account security. Passkeys offer the best combination of security and user experience, while TOTP provides robust protection with broad compatibility across devices and applications.

Regular review of your user list ensures that only current team members have access to your projects. When team members leave or change roles, promptly removing their access prevents unauthorized project access and maintains security boundaries.

For sensitive projects or organizations with compliance requirements, enterprise features provide the additional security controls and audit capabilities needed to meet regulatory standards while maintaining collaborative development workflows.
