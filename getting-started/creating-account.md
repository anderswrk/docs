# Creating Your Account

Getting started with Kliv is simple and only takes a few moments. You can create an account through multiple methods and start building immediately.

## Sign-Up Process

Creating a Kliv account happens automatically when you start building your first website. Simply visit the Kliv homepage, describe what you want to build in the text box, and click "Create My Site." If you don't have an account yet, you'll be directed to the sign-up page as part of the process.

The sign-up flow is designed to be as frictionless as possible—you can start building your website idea immediately without lengthy setup processes or configuration steps.

## Authentication Options

Kliv offers two convenient ways to create and access your account:

**Email and Password:** Create an account using your email address and a secure password. This traditional method works universally and gives you complete control over your login credentials.

**Google Sign-In:** Use your existing Google account to sign up and log in instantly. This option leverages Google's security infrastructure while eliminating the need to remember another password. Simply click the Google button during sign-up or login.

Both methods provide the same access to all Kliv features and can be used interchangeably. You can also add additional authentication methods to your account later for enhanced security.

## What Happens After Sign-Up

Once your account is created, you're immediately taken to the Kliv workspace where the AI begins building the website you described. There's no additional setup required—you can start collaborating with the AI assistant right away.

Your account starts on the free plan, which includes ten credits per day, hosting for your websites, and access to all core features. You can upgrade to a professional plan anytime if you need more credits or advanced features like custom domains.

## Account Features

Every Kliv account includes:

**Project Management:** Create and manage multiple websites under your account. Each project gets its own workspace and published URL.

**Team Collaboration:** Invite team members to collaborate on your projects. Free accounts support up to 10 users, while professional accounts have unlimited team members.

**Security Options:** Enable two-factor authentication, manage connected devices, and control account access through your profile settings.

**Credit Monitoring:** Track your credit usage and understand your consumption patterns through the credit display and detailed usage analytics.

## Getting Started

After creating your account, the best way to learn Kliv is to start building. Your first project will give you hands-on experience with the AI assistant, the live preview system, and the publishing process.

If you started with a custom description, continue refining your website through conversation with the AI. If you want to explore templates, you can always create additional projects from the App Store.

Remember that your free account gives you plenty of credits to explore and learn the platform, so don't hesitate to experiment with different ideas and features.
