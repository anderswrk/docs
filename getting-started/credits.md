# Understanding Credits

Credits are the usage currency that powers your interactions with Kliv's AI assistant. The system is designed to be simple and predictable, charging based on whether the AI takes action on your project or simply provides guidance through conversation.

## How Credit Consumption Works

The credit system operates on two tiers based on the type of response you receive from Kliv's AI. When you chat with the assistant, the credit usage depends entirely on whether Kliv performs actions on your project or responds with information and guidance.

Full credits are consumed when Kliv takes any action on your project. This includes editing files, creating new components, making code changes, fixing bugs, installing dependencies, or any other modification to your website. These actions represent the AI actively building or changing your project, which requires computational resources and generates tangible value in your development process.

Half credits are used for conversational responses where Kliv provides information, explanations, or guidance without making changes to your project. This includes answering questions about your site, explaining how features work, providing design suggestions, or offering troubleshooting advice. These interactions are valuable but don't modify your actual project files.

## Free vs Pro Credit Systems

The credit system works differently depending on your subscription level, with each approach designed to serve different user needs and usage patterns.

### Free Plan Structure

Free users operate on a daily credit allowance system that provides up to ten credits per day, with a monthly maximum of thirty credits. This daily refresh system means you start each day with up to ten credits available, regardless of how many you used the previous day. Unused credits don't carry over to the next day, ensuring fair distribution of resources across all free users.

The daily limit prevents any single user from consuming excessive resources while still providing enough credits for meaningful development work. This structure is ideal for learning, experimenting with features, and building smaller projects at a comfortable pace. The monthly cap of thirty credits provides a safety net that ensures the daily system works fairly for everyone.

### Pro Plan Flexibility  

Pro subscribers receive their full monthly credit allowance at the beginning of each billing cycle, with no daily restrictions on usage. This means you can use all your credits in a single day if you're working intensively on a project, or spread them throughout the month based on your workflow preferences.

Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle rather than rolling over, encouraging regular platform engagement while providing predictable monthly limits. This system is designed for professional users who need the flexibility to work intensively on projects without artificial daily constraints.

Pro users also receive additional benefits beyond credit allocation. Most notably, the "Made with Kliv" attribution badge is automatically removed from all published sites, providing a completely branded experience for your projects. Pro subscribers also receive priority hosting performance and enhanced support response times.

## Credit Management and Optimization

Your credit balance is always visible in your project dashboard, along with information about your current plan's refresh schedule. Free users can see when their next daily refresh occurs, while Pro users can track their monthly allowance and usage patterns.

The most effective way to optimize credit usage is understanding the difference between action requests and informational queries. When you're planning changes or want to understand how something works, ask questions first using half-credit responses. This helps you make informed decisions before requesting changes that consume full credits.

Activities like viewing your projects, accessing published sites, browsing the template gallery, and managing your account don't consume any credits. Only interactions with the AI assistant that result in responses consume credits, whether conversational or action-based.

## Subscription Considerations

The credit system is designed to scale with your needs and usage patterns. Free users can evaluate the platform and build smaller projects without cost, while Pro subscribers get the flexibility and additional features needed for professional development work.

Both plans provide transparent, predictable usage costs without hidden fees or surprise charges. The system ensures platform resources are distributed fairly while giving you the freedom to work at your own pace and take breaks as needed without losing progress or facing time pressure.
