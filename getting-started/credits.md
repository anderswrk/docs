# Understanding Credits

Credits are the currency that powers your Kliv experience. This simple system ensures fair usage while giving you the flexibility to build at your own pace.

## How the Credit System Works

Credits are consumed based on the type of interaction you have with Kliv's AI assistant:

### **Full Credit (1 Credit)**
Used when the AI takes **action** on your project:
- Editing or creating files
- Making code changes
- Adding new features or components
- Fixing bugs or errors
- Installing dependencies
- Any modification to your project

### **Half Credit (0.5 Credits)**
Used for **conversational responses** without actions:
- Answering questions about your project
- Providing explanations or guidance
- Discussing design options
- Code reviews or suggestions
- General help and troubleshooting

## Credit Usage Examples

**Actions That Use 1 Full Credit:**
- "Add a contact form to my homepage"
- "Change the color scheme to blue and white"
- "Create a new about page"
- "Fix the mobile responsiveness issue"
- "Install a chart library and create a dashboard"

**Responses That Use 0.5 Credits:**
- "How do I make my site load faster?"
- "What's the best way to organize my navigation menu?"
- "Can you explain how the contact form works?"
- "What are some good color combinations for my brand?"
- "Help me understand this error message"
