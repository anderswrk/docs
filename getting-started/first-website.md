# Your First Website

Welcome to building your first website with Kliv! This guide will help you understand your options and get started on the right path for your project.

## Choosing Between Templates and Starting Fresh

One of your first decisions is whether to start with a pre-built template or begin with a blank canvas. Both approaches have their advantages, and the right choice depends on your specific needs.

### ðŸŽ¨ **Start with a Template (Recommended for Most Users)**

**Best for:** Quick launches, proven designs, and when you find something close to your vision

**Advantages:**
- **Faster Time to Launch** - Templates come with fully functional sections already built
- **Proven Design Patterns** - Professional layouts that work well across devices
- **Complete Feature Sets** - Navigation, forms, layouts, and interactions already implemented
- **Less Initial Guidance Needed** - You can focus on customization rather than explaining every detail

**When to Choose Templates:**
- You found a template that's 70%+ similar to what you want
- You're building a common type of site (portfolio, blog, business site, etc.)
- You want to launch quickly and iterate later
- You prefer to modify existing designs rather than create from scratch

**Template Categories Available:**
- **Business & Corporate** - Professional company sites with services, team pages, and contact forms
- **Portfolio & Creative** - Showcases for designers, photographers, and artists
- **Blog & Content** - Publishing platforms with article layouts and author profiles
- **E-commerce** - Online stores with product catalogs and shopping functionality
- **Landing Pages** - Conversion-focused pages for marketing campaigns
- **SaaS & Apps** - Software product sites with feature highlights and pricing

### ðŸŽ¯ **Start From Scratch**

**Best for:** Unique concepts, specific requirements, and when you want complete creative control

**Advantages:**
- **Complete Creative Freedom** - Every pixel can be exactly as you envision
- **Unique Brand Identity** - Stand out with a completely custom design
- **Tailored Functionality** - Build only what you need, nothing extra
- **Learning Experience** - Understand how each part of your site works

**When to Choose From Scratch:**
- Your concept is unique and doesn't fit existing templates
- You have specific branding requirements that need custom implementation
- You want a minimalist approach with only essential features
- You enjoy the collaborative process of building with the AI
- You have time to iterate and refine through conversation

**What to Expect When Starting Fresh:**
- More detailed conversations about layout and functionality
- Iterative building process as you refine your vision
- Need to specify requirements for navigation, forms, and interactions
- Greater time investment upfront, but more personalized results

### ðŸ”„ **Hybrid Approach: Template + Heavy Customization**

Many successful projects start with a template foundation but undergo significant customization:

1. **Choose a template** with a good basic structure
2. **Replace content** with your own branding and copy
3. **Modify layouts** to better fit your content
4. **Add custom features** that weren't in the original template
5. **Redesign sections** that don't match your vision

This approach gives you the speed of templates with the flexibility of custom development.

## Making Your Decision

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1. **Timeline:** Do you need to launch quickly, or do you have time for iteration?
2. **Uniqueness:** How important is it that your site looks completely different from others?
3. **Complexity:** Are your requirements straightforward or highly specialized?
4. **Content:** Do you have all your content ready, or are you still developing it?

### ðŸ’¡ **Quick Decision Guide:**

- **Choose a Template if:** You want to launch this month, found something 70%+ right, or building a standard type of site
- **Start From Scratch if:** Your concept is unique, you have specific technical requirements, or you want maximum creative control
- **Not Sure?** Start with a template - you can always create a new project from scratch later!
