# Your First Website

Choose between starting with a template or building from scratch, then use Kliv's AI to bring your vision to life.

## Template vs. From Scratch

### **Start with a Template**
Get a fully functional website faster by customizing an existing design.

**Advantages:**
- Multiple pages and features already built
- Professional layouts and navigation
- Faster launch time
- Less detailed prompting required

**Best for:**
- Finding a template that's 70%+ similar to your needs
- Standard websites (portfolio, blog, business, e-commerce)
- Quick launches

**Trade-off:** You'll be somewhat limited by the template's structure and design patterns.

### **Start From Scratch**
Build a completely custom website tailored to your exact requirements.

**Advantages:**
- Complete creative control
- Unique design and functionality
- Build only what you need
- No template constraints

**Best for:**
- Unique concepts that don't fit existing templates
- Specific branding requirements
- Custom functionality needs

**Trade-off:** Requires more detailed prompting and longer development time. You'll get a skeleton initially and need to flesh out each section.

## Quick Decision Guide

- **Template:** Fast launch, standard site type, found something close to your vision
- **From Scratch:** Unique concept, specific requirements, want maximum control
- **Not sure?** Start with a template—you can always create a new custom project later

## Writing Effective Prompts

### **Starting From Scratch**
Give a detailed initial prompt so Kliv understands your vision:
- "Create a photography portfolio with a dark theme, image gallery, about page, and contact form"
- "Build a SaaS landing page with hero section, features, pricing, and testimonials"

### **Making Changes**
Be specific about what and where:
- "Change the header background to navy blue"
- "Add a contact form below the hero section"
- "Make the pricing cards responsive on mobile"

### **Pro Tips**
- Reference specific sections: "In the hero section..."
- Be specific with colors, sizes, and positioning
- Ask to see mobile versions: "Show me how this looks on mobile"

## Testing Your Site

Use the live preview to test your site as you build:

### **Essential Checks**
- Click all navigation links and buttons
- Test forms by filling them out
- Resize browser window to check mobile layout
- Verify images load and look sharp

### **Before Publishing**
- All links work correctly
- Forms submit properly
- Content is proofread
- Site looks good on mobile
