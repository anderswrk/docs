# Quick Start Guide

Get your first Kliv website up and running in under a minute. This abbreviated guide walks you through the essential steps to create and publish your site.

## Start Building

Visit the Kliv website and you'll see a text box where you can describe what you want to build in natural language. Simply type your website idea and click "Create My Site."

If you don't have an account yet, you'll be routed to the sign-up page where you can create an account using your email and password, or sign in instantly with Google by clicking the Google button.

## Watch It Build

Once signed in, you'll immediately enter the Kliv workspace where the AI starts building your site based on your description. You can follow along in real-time as your website comes to life—the entire process takes about a minute.

Your site will be automatically allocated a unique name and published instantly with its own URL on the kliv.site domain.

## Two Ways to Create

If you already have a Kliv account, there are two ways to start a new website:

**From the Dashboard:** Use the text box on your logged-in home screen to describe a custom website that the AI will build from scratch.

**From Templates:** Click the "New Site" button to access the App Store, where you can choose from professionally designed templates and customize them to your needs.

## Next Steps

After your site is created and published, you can continue working with the AI to improve and tailor it. Visit the admin screen to rename your site, unpublish it temporarily if needed, or make adjustments to settings.

The AI assistant is ready to help you modify anything about your site through natural conversation—just describe what you want to change, add, or improve.
