# What is Kliv?

Kliv is an AI-powered web development platform that transforms how you build applications. Through natural conversation, you can create, modify, and deploy professional React applications without writing a single line of code.

## How Kliv Works

Instead of traditional coding, you simply chat with Kliv's AI assistant about what you want to build. Kliv understands your requirements and writes the code for you in real-time. You can see your application come to life instantly in the live preview as changes are made.

**The process is simple:**
1. **Describe** what you want to build
2. **Watch** as Kliv creates your application
3. **Iterate** through conversation to refine features
4. **Publish** with one click when ready
